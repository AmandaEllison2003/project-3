        <h2 class="title">SABRINA’S CAREER</h2>
        <p>
          An actress, recording artist, and songwriter, Sabrina Carpenter
          emerged in 2014 as the star of the Disney Channel series Girl Meets
          World. She then embarked on a successful pop career, issuing albums
          including 2016’s Top 30-charting EVOLution and her fourth full-length,
          2019’s Singular: Act II. In the meantime, she continued to act,
          appearing in movies such as 2019’s Tall Girl and the next year’s
          Clouds. After signing with Island Records, Carpenter released her
          fifth album, 2022’s emails I can’t send, featuring the singles “Skinny
          Dipping,” “Vicious,” and “Fast Times.”

        <h2 class="title">SABRINA’S LIFE</h2>
        <p>
          Annlyne Carpenter in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania on May 11, 1999, she
          became interested in performing at a young age. By age ten, she was
          going to auditions with her parents and won her first part playing a
          guest role on the hit NBC drama Law & Order: SVU. Two years later, she
          was cast as the best friend of Rowan Blanchard on the Disney Channel’s
          coming-of-age sitcom Girl Meets World, the sequel to the immensely
          popular ‘90s sitcom Boy Meets World. Carpenter inked a deal with
          Hollywood Records and issued the single “Can’t Blame a Girl for
          Trying” in March 2014, which was followed by her debut EP of the same
          name a month later. In 2015, she delivered her full-length debut, Eyes
          Wide Open. It peaked at number 43 on the Billboard 200. She returned
          the following year with her sophomore album, EVOLution, and embarked
          on a sold-out headlining tour. Next up was a starring role in the
          Disney Channel’s version of Adventures in Babysitting, a few months
          before EVOLution peaked at number 28 on the Billboard 200.
